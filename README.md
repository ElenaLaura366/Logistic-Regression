# Logistic Regression

This repository contains an implementation of Logistic Regression using Python and PyTorch.

## Description

Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. It is commonly used for binary classification problems, where the outcome is a categorical variable with two possible values.

## Features

- Implementation of Logistic Regression using PyTorch.
- Support for both binary and multi-class classification problems.
- Easy-to-use interface for training and evaluating the model.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
